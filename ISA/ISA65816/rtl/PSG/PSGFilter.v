//        16-tap digital filter
//
//    Currently this filter is only partially tested. The author believes that
//    the approach used is valid however.
//	The author opted to include the filter because it is part of the design,
//	and even this untested component can provide an idea of the resource
//	requirements, and device capabilities.
//		This is a "how one might approach the problem" example, at least
//	until the author is sure the filter is working correctly.
//        
//	Time division multiplexing is used to implement this filter in order to
//	reduce the resource requirement. This should be okay because it is being
//	used to filter audio signals. The effective operating frequency of the
//	filter depends on the 'cnt' supplied (eg 1MHz)
